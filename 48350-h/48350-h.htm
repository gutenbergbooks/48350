<h2>Six Little Ducklings</h2>




<h2>I</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">OLD MOTHER DUCK and her six little
ducklings lived in a hollow tree
down by the river, and here they were
all as happy as the day was long. They had the
whole of the broad bright river to swim about on,
and there was no one to bother them or drive
them about.</p>

<p>Mother Duck had not always lived in the hollow
tree. Once she had lived in a farmyard
back in the country and away from the river.
But she had not been very happy there. For one
thing, there was a very cross old watch-dog in the
farmyard. He was kept chained to his dog-house
through the day, and never set loose until
the other animals had gone to bed, but he used
to snap at the ducks and chickens whenever they
came near his dog-house, and that frightened
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was no place to swim but in a
muddy little duck-pond that almost dried up in
the heat of summer.</p>

<p>But the worst thing of all at the farmhouse
was the way the farmer’s wife used to steal the
duck’s eggs. No matter how carefully Mrs.
Duck hid her eggs, Mrs. Farmer always found
them and took them away. Once she put a number
of them in a hen’s nest, and allowed a hen to
set on them. After a while the hen hatched out
eleven of the cunningest, fuzziest, yellowest
ducklings that ever were seen. The hen was
just as pleased and proud as though she had laid
the eggs herself. But she didn’t in the least
know how to bring up a brood of ducklings.
Mrs. Duck could see that very plainly. She
didn’t even want them to get their feet wet and
she almost had a fit when they went into the
water one day.</p>

<div class="caption">She pointed with her wing to a farmhouse
in the distance</div>
</div>

<p>After that Mrs. Duck made up her mind she
would not stay at the farm any longer. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a><br /><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a><br /><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
started off into the wide world early one morning
without saying anything to any one, and
waddled on and on and on until after a while
she came to the hollow tree beside the river.</p>

<p>Here she made a nest and hatched out a little
brood for herself, and brought them up the way
young ducklings should be brought up, and was
very happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>




<h2>II</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE were six of the little ducklings,
and their names, beginning with the
eldest were, Squdge and Queek, Buff,
Pin-Toes and Fluffy, and the littlest and cunningest
one of all was named Curly Tail.</p>

<p>Buff and Fluffy and Curly-Tail were girls, and
the other three were boys.</p>

<p>One fine day when the wind was blowing, and
the leaves were rustling, and the little wood-rabbits
jumping high and kicking their heels for joy,
Mother Duck told the little ducklings she was
going to take them for a picnic.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! goody!” they cried, and clapped
their wings for joy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/i_b_007.jpg" width="431" height="544" alt="Ducklings and Mother Duck at home" />
<div class="caption">How cosy it was there in the hollow tree</div>
</div>

<p>Mother Duck got out a little basket of meadow
grass that an old muskrat had made for her, and
she and the children packed it full of luncheon.
There were crisp watercress, and wild celery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
little snails, and all sorts of good things such as
little ducklings like to eat.</p>

<p>As soon as the basket was packed they started
off.</p>

<p>The ducklings thought they would probably
go down to the river, but instead of that Mother
Duck led the way off into the wood, directly
away from the water.</p>

<p>“Where are we going, mother? Where are we
going?” asked the little ducklings. But the
mother only smiled and shook her head and
would not tell them.</p>

<p>After a while they came out of the wood and
into a meadow-land where there was a heap of
high rocks.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we’ll have our picnic,” said
Mother Duck.</p>

<p>She put down the basket, and unpacked the
food, and then she and the ducklings sat down
around it, and ate and ate. And how good it all
tasted! Just as food always does on picnics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had all finished, and could eat no
more, Mother Duck said, “Come now; let us
climb up to the top of the rocks and see what we
can see.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/i_b_011.jpg" width="452" height="495" alt="Duckling under gushing downspout" />
<div class="caption">So he got right under the rain-pipe where the water spouted hardest</div>
</div>

<p>That was fun, too—clambering up over the
rocks. The ducklings scrambled and slipped
and queeked, and their mother helped them; so
after a while they found themselves on the very
tip top of the highest rock of all, and oh, how
the wind did blow up there.</p>

<p>“Now look!” said Mother Duck. “Do you
see over there?” and she pointed with her wing
to a farmyard in the distance. “That is where
I used to live.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother,” cried the ducklings, “we
thought you’d always lived down by the river in
our tree!”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; I lived right there in that farmyard,”
answered their mother; and then she began
to tell them about it, and of her life there,
and of how if she had stayed there they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a><br /><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a><br /><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have had a hen for their mother instead of her.
That seemed a horrible thing to the little ducklings—that
they might have had some other
mother instead of their own. They wanted to
know what a hen was, because of course they had
never seen one, living where they did. Their
mother tried to tell them, but they could not understand
very well.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like a hen for a mother,” cried
Squdge; “but I would like to see a farmyard, and
to hear a dog bark, and a cow moo. Do they
make as big a noise as thunder? Will you take
me there some time, mother?”</p>

<p>But Mother Duck told him, no indeed. It
would be very dangerous to go back to the farmyard.
If the farmer and his wife saw the ducklings
they might catch them and shut them up in
a coop, and never let them get away again.</p>

<p>The thought of that frightened the other ducklings—only
Squdge said stoutly, “She couldn’t
catch <i>me!</i> I can peck too hard and run too fast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and I wish you <i>would</i> take me there some time,
mother, just to see it all.”</p>

<p>Mother Duck made no answer, for looking up
she saw that rain-clouds were gathering over
head.</p>

<p>“Hurry, children, hurry,” she cried. “There’s
going to be a storm, and we must get home before
it begins.”</p>

<p>Down they scrambled in a great hurry, and
started off through the woods as fast as they
could, and they made such good time that they
reached the hollow tree just as the first great
drops began to fall.</p>

<p>They were all out of breath and rather tired,
especially Curly-Tail, but as their mother said,
that did not really matter as long as they had
escaped a wetting.</p>

<h2>III</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HOW cosy it was there in the dry hollow
of the tree, with the rain beating
harder and harder outside and streaming
down the tree trunks.</p>

<p>After a while the ducklings got out their play-things
and began to play with them, but soon
they tired of this, and nestling down about their
mother they begged her to tell them a story.</p>

<p>“A story?” said Mother Duck. “Very well.
What shall it be about?”</p>

<p>“Tell about Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail!”
cried Squdge and Queek.</p>

<p>“No, no; don’t tell about that,” begged Curly-Tail,
almost in tears. “That’s too sad a story,
mother. It always makes me cry.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I wouldn’t be such a baby as to cry
over a story,” cried Squdge. “Go ahead, mother!
Tell it, won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The other four little ducklings wanted to hear
it, too, so Mother Duck told Curly-Tail if she
didn’t want to listen she could run over in the
corner and play by herself for awhile, and when
that story was finished she could come back and
choose another one—any one that she liked, and
her mother would tell it next.</p>

<p>So Curly-Tail, who was always sweet and obedient,
went over in the corner and got out her
doll, and began to play, while Mother Duck told
the others the story.</p>

<p>And this is the sad tale of Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“WIGGLE-WAGGLE-WISK-TAIL
was a very naughty little duckling.
He quarrelled with his brothers and
sisters, and he always wanted the best of everything
for himself, and, worst of all, he was often
disobedient to his dear good mother. Sometimes
his mother hardly knew <i>what</i> to do, it worried her
so to have him so naughty.</p>

<p>“Over and over again Wiggle-Waggle’s
mother had told him that he must never go out
of doors when it was raining. (You know I
have often told you that myself, my dears,” said
Mother Duck. “It is very, very bad for little
ducks to go out in the rain. Flat water, like
ponds and puddles and rivers, is good for them,
but when water comes down from overhead like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rain, or water-falls, it is very bad for them.
Sometimes they get drowned in it.)</p>

<p>“One day it began to rain and rain and rain
around Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail’s house.</p>

<p>“His mother was very busy that day. She did
not have time to watch over the children, but she
never thought any of them would be foolish
enough to go out in the rain. She had told them
too often about the danger of it.</p>

<p>“But Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail would not
believe anything that any one told him. He
waited until his brothers and sisters were busy
over their play, and then he slipped away very
quietly, and out into the rain.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good it felt. He raised his bill and
caught greedily at the drops as they fell.</p>

<p>“‘It’s wet’, said Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail
to himself, ‘but it isn’t wet enough.’</p>

<p>“Just around the corner a rain-pipe came down
from the roof of the farmhouse. The rain
roared down it and spouted out like a waterfall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a><br /><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Whew! This is the wettest thing I ever
saw!’ cried Wiggle-Waggle. ‘I guess this is the
place for me!’</p>

<p>“So he got right under the rain pipe where the
water spouted hardest. It felt good on his back,
and he held up his head, and opened his beak,
and swallowed the water as fast as he could.
Then he was wet inside as well as out—wet
enough at last.</p>

<p>“‘If only mother could see me now,’ he giggled
to himself.</p>

<p>“So he swallowed, and <i>swallowed</i>, and <small>SWALLOWED</small>
until after awhile he was so full of water
that he burst, just like a balloon that has been
blown too full of air; and that was the end of
him.</p>

<p>“Not till the rain was over did his mother find
he was not at home. Then she came out to look
for him, but she could not find him. She called
and called him but he did not answer and he
did not come. He never came home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then his mother wept for him, and his brothers
and sisters wept for him, but they never saw
Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail again, because he
was lying under the rain pipe all burst.”</p>

<p>That was the sad story of Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail
that always made Curly-Tail cry.
Not until it was ended would she come out of
the corner, but when she did come and it was
her turn to choose a story she chose a very different
sort of one for her mother to tell—for
she chose a funny story that made all the little
ducklings laugh and laugh.</p>

<p>But the mother liked to tell them about Wiggle-Waggle-Wisk-Tail
every now and then.
She thought the story was a good lesson for them.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE rain rained itself out in the night,
and the next morning, when the little
ducklings awoke, they found, to their
glee, that the sun was shining bright and clear.
That meant they could go down to the river for
a swim as usual.</p>

<p>Very soon after breakfast the whole family
started for the river. The ducklings ran ahead,
while Mother Duck waddled after them.
Only Curly-Tail stayed by her mother’s side,
walking beside her, and holding to a fold
of her skirt. She always liked to be close to
mother.</p>

<p>“Don’t go in the water until I get there, children,”
Mother Duck called after the others as
they ran ahead.</p>

<p>“No, mother, we won’t,” answered the ducklings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Squdge was a large, stout, active duckling.
He could run faster than any of the others, and
so he was the first to reach the river bank. There
he began looking about for any tid-bits he could
find in the way of a fat beetle, a grass-hopper or
a tadpole. He was a very greedy duckling.
Often and often his mother was obliged to tell
him not to be so greedy, but to share things with
his little brothers and sisters, but he was not always
willing to do this.</p>

<p>Now as he peered about with his bright black
eyes he suddenly espied near the mud-bank a little
round hole, and just showing over the edge
of the hole was what looked like the tail of a
particularly fine, fat worm.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” thought Squdge to himself.
“Here’s a fine fat morsel. I’ll just pull it out
and eat it before any of the others come to share
it with me.”</p>

<p>With his broad little beak he made a dive at
the tail, and pinching it tight he began to pull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/i_b_031.jpg" width="435" height="468" alt="Mrs. Muskrate sharing with two ducklings" />
<div class="caption">She gave one to Fluffy and one to Curly-tail</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a><br /><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the tail did not belong to a worm at all,
but to a little brown snake that had been lying
there in the hole (which was its home) fast
asleep.</p>

<p>When it felt some unseen thing nipping its
tail and holding it, it was terribly frightened.
It began to pull and struggle, trying to get loose,
and Squdge kept pulling and trying to get it out.
It must be a wonderfully fine fat worm to pull so
hard, he thought, and the more it pulled the more
determined he was to have it.</p>

<p>Before he could get it out, however, Queek and
the others saw him, and up they ran, eager for a
share of anything he might have caught.</p>

<p>They, too, seized hold of the tail and began to
pull. All of them together were too strong for
the snake. It had to come. Out they dragged
it, out and out, longer and longer. Last of all
its head slipped out from the hole. Then it
twisted around, hissing with fright.</p>

<p>When the ducklings saw what they had caught—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it was not a worm but a <small>SNAKE</small>—they
were so terrified that they fell over backward
on the ground and lay there, afraid to move.
They dared not even look to see whether the
snake had gone or was making ready to swallow
them. If they had only known it, it had been
just as much frightened as they, and as soon as it
was free it had slipped away into the water to
nurse its pinched tail in quiet.</p>

<p>They were still lying there when their mother
and Curly-Tail reached the place. At first
Mother Duck did not know what had happened
to them; she was afraid they were hurt or sick.
But when she had helped them to their feet, and
found they were only frightened and not hurt at
all she began to laugh at them.</p>

<p>“But now you see, children,” she said more
seriously, “what comes of being greedy. If you
hadn’t been in such a hurry to catch the worm
and gobble it down you would have waited till
I came, and I could soon have told you it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a><br /><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was not a worm you had found, but a snake.”</p>

<div class="caption">Around from the other side of the burdock came a great grey feathery creature</div>
</div>

<p>The little ducks felt quite ashamed of themselves.
They felt they had acted in a very silly
and greedy manner. Moreover, they felt quite
sad, for their mother said they were so hot and
frightened she could not allow them to go into
the water just yet. They would have to sit on
the bank for a while and cool off.</p>

<p>Then she took Curly-Tail down to a shallow
place in the river and caught a nice little tadpole
for her, while her brothers and sisters had
to sit in a row along the bank and look on.</p>

<p>It was not very long, however, before their
mother called to them that they could come, and
the little ducklings ran joyously down the slope
and slipped off into the water. There they paddled
up and down, and stood on their heads, and
ran water races with each other as merrily as ever,
their adventure with the snake quite forgotten.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the ducklings stayed at home
instead of going to the river (that
was when it was too cold and stormy
for them to swim) they had a number of toys to
play with. Squdge and Queek had a little cart,
and they had a tame beetle that they had trained
to pull it. Sometimes they gave the dolls a ride
in the cart. There were two dolls; one belonged
to Fluffy, and one belonged to Curly-Tail. Mrs.
Muskrat had made the dolls for them;—the same
old muskrat who had made the picnic basket for
their mother. The dolls were made of two old
gnarled pieces of root that Mrs. Muskrat had
gnawed and shaped with her sharp teeth until
they looked just like two little wooden ducklings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">

<div class="caption">The two fowls were pleased to see each other</div>
</div>

<p>Fluffy and Curly-Tail loved these two little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a><br /><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a><br /><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
duckling dolls better than anything they had;
they dressed and undressed them, and took them
to bed with them at night, and sometimes even
took them down to the river with them.</p>

<p>The other ducklings often wished they had
dolls, too, but Mrs. Muskrat had only made the
two, one for Fluffy, and one for Curly-Tail.
The way she had happened to make the dolls for
them and not for the others was this:</p>

<p>One day the duck family had gone down to
the river for their usual swim, and afterward
Mother Duck felt very sleepy. She sat down on
the bank in the warm sun, and all the little
ducklings sat around her, and blinked and
blinked, and after a while they all went to sleep.
The ducklings were the first to waken. They
opened their eyes and stirred about, and presently
they said, “Mother, may we go up the river
bank a little way?” For they were tired of staying
in one place.</p>

<p>Mother Duck was too sleepy to do more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
open her eyes a tiny crack. “Yes; only don’t go
too far, and don’t go in the water.”</p>

<p>The little ducks promised they wouldn’t, and
then they ran merrily away together.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a place where the bank was
quite high and overhung the water. Here they
began to amuse themselves by pushing bits of
mud and pebbles over into the water to make a
splash.</p>

<p>Presently they heard something stirring and
rustling down there beneath. They stopped and
listened and looked. Squdge and Pin-Toes
even crept to the edge of the bank and leaned
far over trying to see what was there. Fluffy
was afraid if they did not take care they might
fall into the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/i_b_043.jpg" width="460" height="450" alt="Ducking and chicks" />
<div class="caption">Instead of taking it Bright Eyes looked quite disgusted</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly out from under the bank swam old
Mrs. Muskrat. Her house was just exactly under
where the ducklings were standing, though
they had not known it. She had been busy finishing
her housework and now she was starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a><br /><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
out on some errand she had down the river. She
always swam when she wanted to go anywhere.
She could go more quickly and safely that way
than by land. She had on a calico dress and a
white apron, and a pair of big spectacles were
on her nose. (All her clothes were waterproof,
and shed off the water just the way a duck’s
feathers do.) She looked so funny with her nose
almost under water and her dress bunching up,
and her tail dragging behind her, that some of
the ducklings began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh don’t laugh,” begged Fluffy, who was a
very polite little duckling. “She might hear
you.”</p>

<p>“No she won’t; she can’t hear us down there,”
said Queek.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether she does or not,” cried
Squdge, “she’s so funny looking.” And he
laughed till he almost fell over.</p>

<p>Then all the other ducklings began to laugh,
too;—all except Fluffy and Curly-Tail. Fluffy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and Curly-Tail did not laugh. They were troubled
to think their brothers and sister could behave
so rudely, and to an older animal. To be
sure Mrs. Muskrat never looked round to see who
they were, and that was some comfort.</p>

<p>Now as it happened the old muskrat did not
have to look round in order to see them, though
the ducklings did not know that. When the light
shone on her spectacles it made them just like
looking-glasses, and she could see in them what
was happening behind her. She saw, in her spectacles,
that Squdge was laughing and pointing at
her. She saw the others laughing, too, all except
Fluffy and Curly-Tail, and she saw that those
two did not laugh, but looked worried and sorry.
She saw all this, but she did not take any notice
of it. She just swam quietly on down the river
and out of sight.</p>

<p>But two or three days afterward an old toad
knocked at the hollow tree and said he had a
message for Mrs. Duck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">

<div class="caption">The chicks huddled together on the leaf while the ducklings pulled it</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>This toad had been living down by the river
for some time, but it was so damp there that it
had given him rheumatism, so he had determined
to come up and live in the wood where it was
dryer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Muskrat had heard of this, and so she
asked him, as he would be going past the hollow
tree to leave a message there for her.</p>

<p>This was the message. She wanted Mother
Duck to send the two little ducklings who hadn’t
laughed at her the other day down to see her.
It was about something very important.</p>

<p>“That’s me and Curly-Tail, mother! We
were the ones who didn’t laugh,” cried Fluffy.
“But what do you s’pose she wants with us,
mother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but you had better go and see.”</p>

<p>The two little ducklings were not very anxious
to do this. They felt very shy about going all
alone down the river to make a visit.</p>

<p>“<i>I’ll</i> go,” said Squdge. “I don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“No indeed you won’t go,” said the mother.
“You’ve been too naughty. Mrs. Muskrat
doesn’t want to see any little duckling that has
been as rude to her as you have been.” At last
she told Fluffy and Curly-Tail that she herself
would go part of the way with them.</p>

<p>She took them down within sight of the muskrat’s
house, and then she sent them on alone.</p>

<p>Fluffy and Curly-Tail walked on very slowly,
often stopping to look back at their mother as she
stood there watching them.</p>

<p>“Will you knock when we get there, Curly-Tail?”
asked Fluffy.</p>

<p>“No, you knock.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t like to; you knock.”</p>

<p>But as it turned out neither of them had to
knock at Mrs. Muskrat’s door, for when they
reached her house she was on the lookout for
them. She came out smiling, and looking quite
friendly and pleasant in spite of her long rat
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a><br /><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“So you are the two little ducklings who didn’t
laugh at me the other day,” she said. “That’s
right! That’s right! I like little animals when
they are polite and respectful. Now I have a
present for you that I think you’ll like.”</p>

<p>She went back into the house, and when she
came out again she carried the two little duckling
dolls. “Here; these are for you,” she said, and
she gave one to Fluffy and one to Curly-Tail.</p>

<p>The little ducklings could hardly believe their
eyes. They had never seen anything so cunning
and pretty before. “But they’re not for <i>us?</i>”
they cried. “Not really?”</p>

<p>“Yes they are,” said Mrs. Muskrat, smiling,
and looking almost as pleased as they.</p>

<p>The two little ducklings hardly knew how to
thank her enough. Then they were eager to
show the dolls to their mother. They said good-bye
to the muskrat, and ran back to where Mother
Duck was waiting for them, “Look, mother!
Look! Look!” they cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Duck took the dolls and examined them.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, they are very beautiful,” she said.
“Wasn’t Mrs. Muskrat good to give you such
wonderful presents. You must be very careful
not to break them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will! We will!” cried the happy
little ducklings.</p>

<p>When they got back to the tree, and the others
saw the beautiful presents Mrs. Muskrat had
given them they wished they hadn’t laughed at
her either; then perhaps she would have given
them dolls too. But it was too late for wishing
that now.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“I’LL race you down to the big burdock,
Queek,” said Squdge one day, as he and
the others started out for the river with
Mother Duck.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Let’s all race,” cried Buff, who could run almost
as fast as her brothers.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Queek; “only we’ll have to
give Fluffy and Curly-Tail a start, because they
can’t run as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>So Fluffy and Curly-Tail went some distance
down the path, and then Squdge shouted “Go!”
and away they all raced.</p>

<p>“Wait for me at the burdocks!” their mother
called after them. “Don’t go down to the river
without me.” But the ducklings were racing
too hard to stop to answer her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The little ducks all reached the burdocks at
about the same time, though Squdge was a little
ahead. They were so out of breath that they
were glad to drop down in the shadow to get
cooled off while they waited for their mother.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they sat there, they heard, back
of the burdocks, a curious scratching and rustling,
and a something that sounded like “Cluck!
cluck! cluck!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Squdge?” whispered Queek.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is.”</p>

<p>“I’m scared,” said Buff, “it sounds so queer.
Let’s run back and find mother.”</p>

<p>The ducklings jumped up, but before they
could run away, around from the other side of
the burdock came a great grey, feathery creature,
with hard, bright eyes and a sharp beak. She
was followed by a brood of little, downy, yellow
young ones that seemed to be her children. As
soon as the young ones saw the ducklings they
stopped and stared at them wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">

<div class="caption">So the two fowls said good-bye to each other and parted</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cluck! cluck!” cried the mother. “What
have we here? Ducklings I do believe.” Then
as Squdge seemed about to come toward her she
ruffled her feathers angrily. “Don’t you come
any nearer,” she cried, “if you do I’ll peck you.
I don’t allow any strange animals to come near
<i>my</i> children.”</p>

<p>The ducklings were quite frightened at her
angry looks. They were about to turn and run
away, when to their joy they saw their mother
coming around a bend in the path.</p>

<p>As soon as Mother Duck saw a stranger talking
to her children she hurried forward. Then
when she came a little nearer she gave a quack of
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Henny Penny!” she cried. “Is
that you? Wherever did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Well I declare if it isn’t Mrs. Duck!” replied
the hen. “I brought the children out for
a walk, and we’ve come further than we expected.
I’m sure I never thought I’d find you here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The two fowls were so pleased to see each
other that they both began talking at once, asking
questions, and givings answers, while the little
ones listened wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re still living at the farm,”
said the duck. “And these are your little ones,
are they? What fine chicks they are.”</p>

<p>“You have some fine children, yourself,” answered
the hen, much pleased. “How exactly
they look like you.”</p>

<p>“They’re very good children, on the whole,”
said the duck, “only sometimes they’re rather
naughty, and I have to scold them a little. But
how are all the things at the farmyard? The
geese and the turkeys and the guinea-fowls?
And old Mr. Tige? Is he alive still? My, my!
What a cross dog he was.”</p>

<p>The hen said yes, he was. “He’s alive still, and
crosser than ever. Why the other day old Mrs.
Speckeldy Hen just happened to go too near his
dog house, and he jumped right out at her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a><br /><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
pulled out a whole mouthful of tail feathers!”</p>

<p>“My!” cried the duck. “Wasn’t that awful?
What did Mr. Rooster say?”</p>

<p>“Why he said—”</p>

<p>Just then the duck noticed that all the little
ones were standing about and listening with open
beaks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/i_b_063.jpg" width="398" height="364" alt="Mother Duck talking to ducklings" />
<div class="caption">“Now, children, I am going to market,” she said</div>
</div>

<p>“Now, children, don’t stand there listening,”
she cried. “You know I don’t like you to listen
when older creatures are talking. Run on down
to the river, and take these nice little chicks along
with you—only don’t go in till I come. Perhaps
you might catch them a tadpole or so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, run along,” said the hen. “We’ll be
along in a minute. Be sure you don’t get your
feet wet, children.”</p>

<p>That seemed to the ducklings a funny thing
for any one to say—“Don’t get your feet wet,”—but
they and the chicks started off together, and
ran on gaily down the path toward the river,
while the older fowls followed more slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the little ones reached the river
Squdge, who had taken a great fancy to a little
chicken named Bright-Eyes, ran down to a shallow
where the tadpoles lived, and caught a nice
fat one, and brought it to her in his beak. Instead
of taking it, however, Bright Eyes looked
quite disgusted.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” she cried. “Take it way. The nasty
thing!”</p>

<p>“Nasty!” cried Squdge with surprise. “Why
it’s good. Haven’t you ever eaten a tadpole
before?”</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t want to eat one now,
either.”</p>

<p>All the other chickens said the same, so Squdge
ate the tadpole himself, and very good it tasted
to him, too.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Queek; “I don’t believe
mother would mind if we went in here
where the water is shallow, and had a swim. It’s
deep enough if we hold up our legs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a><br /><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we don’t know how to swim,” cried the
chickens.</p>

<p>Not know how to swim! The ducklings could
hardly believe it. “Why, what do you do when
you go in the water?” they asked.</p>

<p>“We don’t go in the water!”</p>

<p>The ducklings stared at them with pity and
surprise. They had never heard of such a thing
as not going in the water. Then Squdge had a
bright idea. “I know!” he cried; “let’s give the
chicks a ride on the river. We’ll get a big leaf
and have it for a boat, and then the chicks can
get on it, and we’ll pull it.”</p>

<p>The chicks did not like the idea very much.
They were afraid. But the ducklings were so
eager about it that they hardly knew how to say
no.</p>

<p>Squdge found a big leaf and he and the others
nipped it off with their sharp beaks, and pulled
it down into the river. “Now get on it,” they
shouted joyously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we’re afraid,” whimpered the chicks.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on! it won’t hurt you. You’ll just
love it, it’s such fun.”</p>

<p>Timidly the chicks stepped onto the leaf, and
huddled together in the middle of it while the
ducklings pulled it out into the stream.</p>

<p>“Faster, faster,” cried Squdge, holding the
stem with his beak, and swimming as hard as he
could. “Here! Take it around this rock.”</p>

<p>The water washed over the leaf, and the chickens
shrieked with fear. A moment later the boat
caught on a ledge and at once tilted over so that
the chickens were upset into the water.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” cried Buff. “Look what we’ve
done.”</p>

<p>The ducklings hurried to the help of the chicks,
and pushing and pulling they managed to get
them up on the rock where they were safe.</p>

<div class="caption">“Well, you can come along with men and I’ll show it to you”</div>
</div>

<p>The chickens were dripping wet however and
so frightened they hardly knew where they were.
“Oh! oh!” they wept. “We’ll be drowned! We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a><br /><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a><br /><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
want to go home. Oh! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!”</p>

<p>The ducklings stood looking on in dismay, not
knowing what to do or say.</p>

<p>At this moment a shriek sounded from the
bank. “Oh, my chicks! my chicks!”</p>

<p>The duck and the hen had reached the river
side, and the hen had seen her chickens far out on
a rock, wet and shivering with fear. “Oh what
shall I do! What shall I do,” she shrieked.
“They can never get back.”</p>

<p>“Yes they can, too; now don’t you be so worried,”
said the duck. “I’ll bring them back.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t; I know you can’t. How can
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, easily enough. I’ll swim out to them,
and they can sit on my back, and I’ll carry them
back.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll spill them off. I’m sure you will.”</p>

<p>“No I won’t either. I’ll bring one at a time.
Now just you watch.”</p>

<p>The duck slipped off into the water, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
reached the rock where the chicks were standing.
At first she had a great deal of trouble in getting
any one of them to climb up on her back. They
were afraid of slipping off into the water; but
presently Bright-Eyes ventured to scramble up
and snuggle down against Mother Duck’s
neck. As soon as she was settled there the
old duck sailed out on the water and carried
the little chick safely over to her
mother.</p>

<p>When the other two chicks saw that Bright-Eyes
was safe on shore they were eager to
clamber upon the duck’s back and have her carry
them over, too.</p>

<p>Oh, how thankful the hen was when she had
her chicks back on dry land again. She felt so
happy and thankful that she hardly knew what
to say to the duck.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for you they would all have
been drowned,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, but if it hadn’t been for my children they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a><br /><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a><br /><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wouldn’t have been out there at all,” replied the
duck.</p>

<p>She wanted the hen to bring the chickens up to
the hollow tree to rest and get dry, but this
the hen would not do. There was nothing she
wished so much now as to get her chicks safe
home again. She made up her mind that never,
never would she venture away from the farmyard
again—at least until the chicks were old
enough and big enough to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>So the two fowls said good-bye to each other
and parted, and then Mother Duck took her children
home again without allowing them to go in
for another swim. They had indeed been very
naughty and disobedient little ducklings, and
Mother Duck told them that for a punishment
they would not be allowed to go down to the
river again for three whole days.</p>

<p>That was indeed a sad thing for the little
ducks. They almost cried over it. But then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
might have been worse. She might have told
them they couldn’t go back again for a week.
They had been naughty enough almost to deserve
even that.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Mother Duck got up bright and
early, and put on her bonnet and her
shawl, and took a market basket on her
wing.</p>

<p>“Now, children, I’m going to market,” she said.
“Don’t go out of sight of home while I’m
away, and don’t go down to the river, and don’t
talk with any stranger animals.”</p>

<p>And all the little ducklings answered, “No,
mother.”</p>

<p>Then the old duck put on her bonnet and her
shawl, and took her basket on her arm and started
off.</p>

<p>For awhile after she had gone the little ducks
played about close to the hollow tree, and then
they wandered a little further off, and then they
began to see how far they could go without losing
sight of home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish mother would hurry back,” said
Squdge at last, “I’m getting hungry. Wouldn’t
a tadpole or some watercress taste good now!”</p>

<p>“Indeed it would,” said Queek. “Or even a
beetle if we could find one.”</p>

<p>Just as Queek said that a bright long-tailed fly
flew close by over Buff’s head. “Catch it, catch
it, Buff!” cried Queek.</p>

<p>Buff made a jump and missed it, though his
beak just grazed its tail.</p>

<p>“Catch it!” cried Squdge, starting after it with
leaps and bounds; and—“Catch it! catch it!”
cried the others, running after him as fast as they
could. Their mother’s words were all forgotten.</p>

<p>On and on they went, leaping and snatching,
and sometimes falling over each other in their
hurry. At last their chase led them out into a
road, and then the fly rose straight up over their
heads, up and up until it was lost to sight in the
sunlit air. The ducklings stood gaping after it
hungrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hey there, you young ’uns! What do you
think you’re doing?” asked a rough voice.</p>

<p>The ducklings started.</p>

<p>Before them, in the road, stood a ragged, impudent-looking,
half-grown chicken.</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re doing?” he asked
again.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you please, sir, we were trying to catch
a fly,” answered Queek rather timidly.</p>

<p>“A fly! What did you want to catch a fly
for?”</p>

<p>“We thought we’d eat it.”</p>

<p>“Eat it! Eat a fly? Haven’t you any corn or
bread or things of that kind at home?”</p>

<p>Queek shook his head. “We don’t know what
corn is, or bread either.”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t know what they are!</i> Why, at the
farmyard where I live the farmer’s wife comes
out twice a day and gives us all we can eat.
Sometimes she gives us a dish of curds, too; or a
meat bone to pick. Though mostly we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
share our meat bones with the watch-dog. He’s
a great friend of mine, old Mr. Tige is. He’d
let me have his bones any time if I wanted them.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tige!” cried Squdge. “Why, that’s the
name of the watch-dog at the farm where our
mother used to live. Where is your farmyard?”</p>

<p>“Oh, over there,” said the chicken, pointing
with his wing. “Who is your mother, anyway?”</p>

<p>The ducklings told him who their mother was,
and where they lived, and all about themselves.</p>

<p>They, in turn, asked him about the farmyard.</p>

<p>“I’m just sure that’s where our mother used to
live,” said Buff. “Oh, how I wish we could see
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can. Come along with me, and I’ll
show it to you.”</p>

<div class="caption">On and on ran the chicken, and on and on ran the ducklings</div>
</div>

<p>“All right,” cried Squdge and Queek.</p>

<p>The other four ducklings were afraid they
oughtn’t to go, but Squdge and Queek were so
eager to, and so unwilling to turn back, that after
a while the others, too, agreed to go on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a><br /><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a><br /><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
farmyard. The ragged chicken led the way, and
they all followed.</p>

<p>As they went the chicken’s talk was all about
himself and the farmyard. He told them of how
much the farmer’s wife thought of him, and about
his friend the turkey-cock, and about old Tige.</p>

<p>“Why,” he cried, “I don’t know what Tige
would do if anything was to happen to me. I
guess he’d just break his chain and come out to
look for me.”</p>

<p>The ducklings thought the chicken must be a
very important person indeed for every one to
be so fond of him.</p>

<p>After a while they came to a high board fence.
The chicken slipped through a hole, and the ducklings
followed him, and at once they were in the
farmyard.</p>

<p>Once inside they looked about them wonderingly.
Not far from them a hen was busily
scratching for a brood of chickens. At first they
thought it must be the hen they had met down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the river, but then they saw that this was a larger,
darker hen. A cock on the dung-hill crowed loud
and clear, and the ducklings started. “What’s
that?” asked Squdge in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>“That? Oh, that’s nothing. That’s just a
rooster crowing. Didn’t you ever hear one before?”</p>

<p>Over in a sunny corner were four great moving,
breathing things, lifted far, far up in the air on
great thick legs. “And what are those?” asked
Squdge, pointing at them.</p>

<p>“Cows. Didn’t you ever see cows before?
Oh, my! You certainly don’t know much,” said
the chicken scornfully.</p>

<p>The little ducklings looked at the cows with
awe. Any one of those great feet, if it happened
to tread on them would crush them as easily as
though they were beetles or tadpoles.</p>

<p>“And where’s your friend, Mr. Tige?”</p>

<p>“Old Tige?” said the chicken, hesitatingly.
“Well, you see he may be asleep. If he is I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
wouldn’t like to waken him. He has to bark so
much in the night that sometimes he’s very tired
in the day-time.”</p>

<p>“But can’t we just <i>see</i> what he looks like?”</p>

<p>“Well—come on; maybe I can show you. He
lives in that dog house over there.”</p>

<p>The chicken led the way toward the dog house,
and the ducklings followed him. He walked on
his tip-toes, and kept whispering to the ducklings
not to make a noise. They might almost have
thought that he was afraid of Tige if he hadn’t
told them he wasn’t.</p>

<p>They reached the dog house and peeped around
the corner of it. There, sure enough, lay old
Tige in the sunshine, fast asleep. He was a big,
fierce looking brindled dog. Now and then he
twitched his ear or moved his paw in his dreams.
It frightened the ducklings even to look at him.</p>

<p>When the chicken saw the dog was asleep he
grew much bolder. “Yes, there he is, fast asleep,
just like I told you,” he said. “Do you see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bone there by his nose? If he was only awake
I’d ask him to give it to you. He would do it I
know, if <i>I</i> asked him.”</p>

<p>Just then the great dog woke and opened one
eye a little, but the chicken did not notice that,
he was so busy boasting to the ducklings.</p>

<p>Now the dog was not really a friend of the
chicken at all. In fact he hated it. It was always
creeping up and trying to steal his food.
Again and again he had tried to catch it, but always
it kept just out of reach. But now it had
come so near, that it almost seemed as though,
with one bound he could grab it. Very, very
quietly he drew himself together, without the
chicken’s noticing it, and then suddenly with a
bound and a roar he was up and at the chicken.
He would have caught it, too, if his chain had
only been a <i>little</i> longer. As it was his teeth just
grazed its feathers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;">
<img src="images/i_b_091.jpg" width="451" height="406" alt="Chicken leaves ducklings" />
<div class="caption">He gave them one scornful look and stalked away</div>
</div>

<p>The chicken gave a wild squawk, and fled with
spread wings toward the hole in the fence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a><br /><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ducklings tumbled after it, almost scared out of
their wits.</p>

<p>The chicken squeezed through the hole and
rushed on down the road, and the little ducks,
too, squeezed through the hole and ran after it.</p>

<p>On and on ran the chicken, and on and on ran
the ducklings. For all they knew the dog might
have broken his chain and be close at their
heels.</p>

<p>After a while they came to the river and could
go no further. But it was a part of the river that
the ducklings had never seen before. Here the
chicken turned on them angrily.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go home?” he cried. “Why
do you keep following me? I don’t want you.
Go home I tell you.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t know how to get home,” cried
the ducklings, and Curly-Tail began to cry.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care where you go, only don’t
keep following me because I won’t have it. I’m
tired of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t; we won’t follow you if you’ll just
tell us how to get home.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t tell you. I’m going back to the
farmyard. It must be feeding time now. And
don’t you dare to come too. If you do I’ll peck
you.”</p>

<p>The chicken was angry because the ducklings
had seen him frightened, and because they had
found out he was not a friend of the dog after all.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do! We’re lost! We’re
lost!” wept the ducklings.</p>

<p>But the chicken paid no attention to them.
He gave them one scornful look, and then he
stuck his wings in his pockets, and stalked away
up the road, leaving them alone.</p>

<p>And now the poor little ducklings were very
miserable indeed. They all wept bitter tears.
Even Squdge began to cry. “Oh, if we could
only get home,” they wept, “we’d never, never
run away again, but always be good obedient
little ducklings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Queek, who had dried his eyes for a
moment, looked up the river and gave a cry of
joy.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” he shouted.</p>

<p>The ducklings stared through their tears, and
then they began to clap their wings and shout for
joy. There, sailing quietly down the river, in
her shawl and bonnet, her basket on her arm,
came their own dear mother.</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother!” they shouted all together.
“Here we are, mother! Come quick!”</p>

<p>The mother looked and stared and then came
sailing over toward the bank. She could hardly
believe her eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, children, whatever are you doing
here?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, we ran away from home, and we got lost,
but if you’ll only take us back we’ll never be
naughty disobedient little ducks again.”</p>

<p>They had indeed been very naughty to run
away when their mother had told them not to, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they looked so frightened and sorrowful that she
had not the heart to scold them.</p>

<p>“Well, well! We won’t talk about it now,”
she said. “Perhaps you’ve been punished
enough as it is by being so frightened. Slip
down into the river and I’ll take you home this
way.”</p>

<p>So the ducklings slid down into the water and
sailed away at their mother’s side, and it was not
long before they came within sight of their own
dear home-landing and the hollow tree beyond.
Then what thankful and happy little ducklings
they were!</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Squdge solemnly, “I’m never,
never going to be naughty again. I’m always going
to do exactly what you tell me to do.”</p>

<p>And all the other little ducklings said the same.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that,” said their
mother. “What a happy family we will be if I
never have to scold you any more.”</p>

<p>But of course the little ducklings were naughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a><br /><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<i>sometimes</i>, even after that; but they were good
enough for their mother to feel that on the whole
her little ducklings were the dearest, sweetest,
cunningest little ducklings in all the world—to
her at least.</p>
